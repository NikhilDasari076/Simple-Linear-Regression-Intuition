# Simple Linear Regression Intuition

This repository provides a hands-on, intuitive exploration of Simple Linear Regression (SLR) concepts. It focuses on building a deep understanding of key components such as slope, intercept, and the loss function, and how these elements affect the regression line.

## Overview

In this project, you will find:

- Exploratory analysis of the relationship between variables  
- Calculation and interpretation of slope and intercept  
- Visualizations demonstrating the impact of slope and intercept on the regression line  
- Analysis of the loss function surface and how it guides the selection of optimal parameters  
- Step-by-step example calculations with residuals and squared errors  
- Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks supporting the concepts
